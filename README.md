# ST 495: Advanced Computing for Statistical Methods

I completed a final project for ST 495. I was assigned project instructions with two major goals (a) conducting a simulation study and (b) implementing a bootstrapping approach. 

Please take a look at the ST_495_Final_Project.pdf for a description of my analysis.

The data set I used is publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/9/auto+mpg). 

The code used in this project has the following files and methods: 
1. RealDataAnalysis.r
2. SimStudy.r
3. SimStudyResults.r
4. Bootstrap.r
5. BootstrapResults.r
6. workflow.sh
